This is a repo for a guide to producing Small Area Estimates (SAE) of poverty using the combination of survey and geo-spatial data, using the example of Bangladesh.

The main file is: Quarto updated BGD geo-spatial covariates process.qmd

•	Audience: 
o	Some statistical training
o	Understanding of regression/statistical modelling. 
o	Understanding, previous experience of R/RStudio. 
o	We don’t assume people have any geospatial analysis knowledge/experience. 

1.	Non-technical introduction to the problem
a.	Relatively short 
b.	Non-technical explanation of the problem. 
c.	Exciting. 
d.	Visual as much as possible. 
e.	Explain the audience. 
i.	Help decide the reader whether this is for them or not. 
f.	Explain technical pre-requisites
i.	Computing power, etc.  
2.	The ‘core’ guide
a.	How to use this guide. 
i.	Each section could be used/gone through on their own (i.e. you can start with Section B, we provide the data output to run that on the Bangladesh example.)
b.	Section A: Getting the data you need. 
i.	Introduction: Non-technical description of what you do in this section. 
1.	Step by step diagram that explains the process.
